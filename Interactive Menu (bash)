# We will first make a variable called "SLEEP" that will be used to cause a 5-second dely throughout the script
SLEEP=5

# We then create a "while" loop so after a user makes an input, it will be displayed
# for five seconds before returing to the menu

while [[ "$REPLY" != 5 ]]; do
    clear

# Now, we will create a list of options that our user can choose from
# When chosen, an action will run that will display the corrisponding information

echo "Please Select One of the Following Options:"

# using "echo -e" will allow echo to regonice special actions, such as the "\n" line-break
echo -e "\n"

echo "1) Kernel Information (Name, Release, Version)"
echo "2) Available Memory on the Server"
echo "3) Free Storage Space on the Server"
echo "4) Top 5 Processes on the Server Sorted by Memory Usage"
echo "5) Exit Script"

# Next, we will create a prompt to recieve input from the user
# This input will tell the program which information to display!

echo -e "\n"


        read -p  "Enter Selection [1-5]> "

echo -e "\n"

# Using the users input, we will create nested "if" statements that will execute a "description" and and "action"
# If the user input is valid "a number between 1-5" the program will execute - if not, they will recieve an error message
# Each "if" statement will be displayed for "5" seconds, before returing back to the main menu
