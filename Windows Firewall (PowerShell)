# The following lines will create variables for each IP we need (with description of corresponding IP)
# After many errors, I found the IP address MUST be made a string with quotation marks 

$SERVER1="192.168.4.2"
$TECHSUPPORT1="192.168.4.5"
$UPDATESERVER="192.168.4.7"
$MYMACHINE="192.168.208.131"
# Now, we can simply use these variables in our scripts were the desired IP would go. This should prevent us from making mistakes when entering IP addresses


# This line will allow INBOUND traffic via SSH (port 22) from TECHSUPPORT1 to our VM machine
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName techsupportssh -Description "Allows incomming SSH traffic from TECHSUPPORT1" -Enabled True -Direction Inbound -Action Allow -Protocol TCP -Localport 22 -LocalAddress $MYMACHINE -RemoteAddress $TECHSUPPORT1

# This line will allow OUTBOUND traffic via FTP (port 21) from our VM to SERVER1
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName serverftp -Description "Allows outgoing FTP traffic to SERVER1" -Enabled True -Direction Outbound -Action Allow -Protocol TCP -RemotePort 21 -LocalAddress $MYMACHINE -RemoteAddress $SERVER1

# This line will allow INBOUND traffic via FTP (port 21) from UPDATESERVER to our VM
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName updateftp -Description "Allows incomming FTP traffic from UPDATESERVER" -Enabled True -Direction Inbound -Action Allow -Protocol TCP -Localport 21 -LocalAddress $MYMACHINE -RemoteAddress $UPDATESERVER

# This line will apply the following firewall rules to each network profiles: Domain, Private, Public
Set-NetfirewallProfile -All -Enabled True

# Next, we will enable logging of the three rules we created, and output the log to a file called "allowedconnectionlog" (we'll make it a .txt)
Set-NetFirewallProfile -NotifyOnListen True -LogAllowed True -LogFileName "C:\Scripts\allowedconnectionlog.txt"
